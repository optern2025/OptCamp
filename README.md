# ⚡ OPTERN PERFORMANCE SPRINT

![Optern Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/optern2025/OptCamp/main/public/banner.png) <!-- Note: Assuming a banner might be added later, or just using text for now -->

> **Real Startups Demand Real Execution.** Resumes prove nothing; performance proves everything.

Optern is a high-stakes, 4-day startup simulation designed to filter for the top 10% of engineering talent. This repository contains the high-performance landing page and registration system for the Optern Gauntlet.

## 🚀 The Vision

Most hiring processes measure theory. **Optern measures real performance.** 
We simulate the intensity, ambiguity, and pressure of a fast-growing startup to identify engineers who can actually *build* and *execute* when it matters most.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built with a focus on speed, precision, and modern aesthetics:

- **Framework:** [Next.js 15+](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha) (Cutting-edge performance)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Strictly typed for durability)
- **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) (Clean, consistent iconography)
- **Linter/Formatter:** [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) (Modern, ultra-fast toolchain)
- **Design:** Modern "Cyberpunk" aesthetic with neon accents (Cyan-500) and high-contrast dark mode.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Cyberpunk UI:** Vibrant neon-cyan accents, glassmorphism, and high-performance gradients.
- **Micro-Animations:** Smooth scroll-driven navigation transitions and glow-pulse effects.
- **Dynamic Simulation Specs:**
  - **The Gauntlet:** A 4-day breakdown of the simulation phases.
  - **Live Cycles:** Real-time cohort block tracking.
  - **Selection Filter:** Multi-step performance-based funnel.
- **Modular Registration Flow:** A fully typed, client-side registration system with state management and validation.
- **Ultra-Responsive:** Optimized for everything from mobile devices to ultra-wide displays.
